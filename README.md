# FoodFinds

<img src="foodfinds screenshots/foodfindscover.png" width=1000><br>

FoodFinds is an app that allows college students to share extra food items with peers. 

FoodFinds seeks to address issues of food waste and food insecurity in a feel-good way, eliminating discomfort users may feel from revealing to their peers that they need an extra meal swipe or would be willing to take food items their peers had given away. To ameliorate any discomfort, in addition to anonymity support, the users who provide "supply" on the app will be the ones to take initiative, and be the ones to make requests for getting leftover meal swipes or snack items getting taken off their hands, while users who represent "demand" on the app will be the ones to respond to those requests. In essence, FoodFinds is turning the tables on any stigma that may have resulted from a user having to reach out to another user to get free food, by flipping the direction of that exchange. 

FoodFinds is an app meant to used by college students looking to give away their unused meal swipes for the week, get the latest scoop on free food opportunities, find out where on campus to grab snacks, or even meet up with a potential new friend and receive a yummy food item as the icing on top. Our motto: don't let food go to waste! eat and share free food around campus!

  </tr>

Currently, Foodfinds is in its second user-centered design (UCD)loop. Across ~10 user research interviews gathered so far, the major risks that have been identified and tackled were people feeling uncomfortable with getting food from others due to stigma surrounding food insecurity issues and differentiating Foodfinds from existing platforms like Sharemeals, Olio, and Facebook marketplace. The risk that still needs to be tackled is incentivizing people to be active on the platform and share food opportunities, whether thhat will involve a sharer-to-receiver review system or visualizations (either in the form of a percentage or points that will convert to badges) of carbon emissions  reduced from food that would have gone to waste. Once again, in making sure that using Foodfinds doesn't feel like an act of charity in giving food to peers in need, Foodfinds's brand values aren't about doing social good for peers, but about doing environmental good for the planet and for the food itself that would have otherwise gone to waste. 

I plan to implement FoodFinds in SwiftUI after getting the Figma prototype to a state where all aspects of the app's core functionality is well represented. I'm excited to revisit the language after the most recent updates since I last used it over the summer!

### Figma File 

Setting up the design system so that it had the feel of a real iOS app and so that I could reuse components definitely took quite a bit of time! One of the most time consuming challenges was actually getting the dimensions of items to be consistent in scale and ensuring that items in a group had the same positioning and alignment (I wish that Figma had Adobe XD's grid drag thingy!). I also used horizontal scrolling for the first time in Figma (I've had more experience previously using Adobe XD and Invision Studio). I used a bunch of icons I found in the Figma community, and started laying out FoodFind's color palette as well. As with my paper prototype (that I had drawn in Notability on my iPad), I decided to go with a light blue as the main theme color, which is quite fitting, as light blue is Columbia University's color, and FoodFinds is meant to be used by Columbia students (before potentially expanding to other college campuses). I wanted the app to feel warm and inviting, yet sleek and clean, with some minimalistic feel. 

Upcoming screens that need to be prototyped:
- Pantry inventory screen
- Profile screen (+ review section, badges section)
- Chat screen & individual chat screens (move chat icon to upper right corner to make room for bookmarked/shortlist tab on tabbar)
- New bookmark/shortlist screen
  - the user can "shortlist" their favorite pantries and be able to access the inventory details from there. This solves the issue of not having a permanent list of pantries to reference to in the list view of the main feed. 
- Create new post screen
  - for pantry, ways to indicate which specific pantry placing item into / different text associated with it from caption + image
  - ^ perhaps it would be better to have an option in the create post screen for which type of post the user wants to create first, and the app can provide them with a template / specific fields that need to be filled out
- Activity screen (with location radius toggle bar)

Smaller things:
- ability of user to post multiple pics, and to swipe through pics in given post gallery style
- login / signup screens
- onboarding / walkthrough tutorial screens 
- drop down menu for filter button in main feed
- (tentative) Columbia / Barnard campus toggle in map view (but user can just change their location themselves as well)
- color-coded pins on map that also indicate time urgency of food (items with smaller time windows of freshness & if the sharer has limited time to get the food item off of their hands)
- different colored nav bars (based on tab selected)
- faq's screen
- (tentative) where to place search bar <-- still kind of need this, but placement is awkward given the current layout of the ui

# Maple

<img src="maplecover.png" width=1000><br>

üçÅ Maple is a social reward platform where users can use points from one restaurant to claim a reward from another, for a premium. More than any loyalty program hub or dining rewards program, this elegant solution has the power to simultaneously nurture meaningful relationships with regulars and offer the flexibility that variety-minded diners desperately crave.

### Brainstorming process 

I worked on Maple over the summer as part of ORIGIN, an entrepreneurship bootcamp program. I was essentially a jack of all trades -- I was product lead, frontend lead, finance lead, and worked on much of the ideation and design prototyping as well. Maple was my first experience in working on a startup from ideation phase. As my product management internship at Mastercard had concluded by July, I was working full time on Maple alongside my teammates and we had many sleepless nights where we kept ideating and debating about pivots. All in all, Maple was the result of 3 pivots, more than 50 user survey responses, more than 40 user interviews, and 10 wireframe testing sessions. Maple got me really excited about entrepreneurship when it comes to bringing an idea to life, designing for the users, and pitching a startup idea. I'm excited to learn more about the business development side of things when it comes to bringing a product in front of stakeholders and acquiring customers.

### Development process

Building the MVP for Maple was also my first time using SwiftUI. As SwiftUI is still a relatively new language, a large part of the challenges came from implementing certain methods that were not supported. For example, when dragging the horizontal carousel view, the ability to have the current card in view slow down and "snap" into place, rather than whizzing past at the same speed as the other cards in the carousel:

Code snippet:

    </td>
  </tr>

Design prototyping for Maple was done primarily in Adobe XD, as well as during the development process itself. The entirety of the profile screen was prototyped in SwiftUI without preliminary design prototyping, as was part of the Market View tab (first screen), as well as the point distribution popup in the Restaurant View.

# Supercharged 

<img src="supercharged screenshots/superchargedcover.png" width=1000><br>

Target Problem: Connecting with and meeting people for professional intentions of building out your network through 1:1 interactions is very time consuming in terms of figuring out who you want to connect to, before cold emailing or messaging them on LinkedIn, and then spending time on back and forth emails in order to schedule a coffee chat. And sometimes, after going through all that effort, the conversation doesn‚Äôt turn out to be that meaningful or helpful for you anyway. Additionally, with everything being virtual now, it‚Äôs difficult to have spontaneous interactions with acquaintances or with people who you usually run into often on campus but haven‚Äôt yet gotten a chance to know well. 

Within this larger problem, I focused on the problem of attending virtual events where a lot of the attendees are like-minded people and then never being able to really connect with them after the event is over. Usually in person, attendees would have the chance to meet each other at events, but that is not very possible with virtual speaker panel events, fireside chats, and webinars held over platforms like Zoom.

Supercharged seeks to provide event attendees with a chance to network after the conclusion of an event. Because it‚Äôs a wide pool of people, the platform will pair each person with another person for quick, speed rounds of 1:1 coffee chats. And after the initial networking sessions, there will also be other opportunities to network within the same group ‚Äì users can select time preferences and choose to opt in for a potential additional networking event, and if there are enough interested people, then the platform will organize another networking session. In this way, people can easily meet each other and will likely have some point of common interest, given that they attended an event together. There is no scheduling hassle and no back and forths ‚Äì the platform will do all the coordination for you.

### Brainstorming Process

<img src="supercharged screenshots/miroboard.png" width=650>

Supercharged actually started out as a personal CRM. Keeping track of my own professional network and growing relationships were pain points that I personally felt. However, after doing research on exisiting platforms (both ones that are currently active and ones that are inactive), I quickly realized that those personal CRM solutions were mainly centered around notifying the user to reach out to people, based on the user's settings of which people they wanted to prioritize in their network and when people's birthdays were. There was only so much that the platform could do -- while those personal CRM platforms had the functionality typical of a CRM in storing the previous history of contacts with a given person, most of the settings that affected how the user got prompted from the app to reach out were manually done. If only there were a personal CRM that scraped through the most recent LinkedIn / Twitter posts of a person in someone's network and somehow knew that the user themself would have something relevant to say based on the post and prompted them to reach out, with a recommendation of what to catch up on. The closest platform has been Monaru, which is more centered around recommending activities to do with personal relationships (in a more social, non-professional setting). 

The current version of Supercharged seeks to bring people together through the platform itself. This, of course, is much more dependent on the number of users who sign up for and are active on the platform, which is a weakness. However, Supercharged's vision is to bring people together post events past just swapping contact information. Supercharged brings people together both post events and through the platform's own networking sessions, matches people to network (both in group networking rounds and in independent 1:1's) based on interests and what people's needs actually are, incentivizes people to keep giving through networking conversations on the platform through giving them first pick of the draw for a future networking session, helps the user keep track of their growing network of people they met through events and through the platform, and much more.
