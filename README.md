### Maple

üçÅ Maple is a social reward platform where users can use points from one restaurant to claim a reward from another, for a premium. More than any loyalty program hub or dining rewards program, this elegant solution has the power to simultaneously nurture meaningful relationships with regulars and offer the flexibility that variety-minded diners desperately crave.
