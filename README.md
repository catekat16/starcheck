# FoodFinds

<img src="foodfinds screenshots/foodfindscover.png" width=1000><br>

FoodFinds is an app that allows college students to share extra food items with peers. 

FoodFinds seeks to address issues of food waste and food insecurity in a feel-good way, eliminating discomfort users may feel from revealing to their peers that they need an extra meal swipe or would be willing to take food items their peers had given away. To ameliorate any discomfort, in addition to anonymity support, the users who provide "supply" on the app will be the ones to take initiative, and be the ones to make requests for getting leftover meal swipes or snack items getting taken off their hands, while users who represent "demand" on the app will be the ones to respond to those requests. In essence, FoodFinds is turning the tables on any stigma that may have resulted from a user having to reach out to another user to get free food, by flipping the direction of that exchange. 

FoodFinds is an app meant to used by college students looking to give away their unused meal swipes for the week, get the latest scoop on free food opportunities, find out where on campus to grab snacks, or even meet up with a potential new friend and receive a yummy food item as the icing on top. Our motto: don't let food go to waste! eat and share free food around campus!

# Maple

<img src="maplecover.png" width=1000><br>

üçÅ Maple is a social reward platform where users can use points from one restaurant to claim a reward from another, for a premium. More than any loyalty program hub or dining rewards program, this elegant solution has the power to simultaneously nurture meaningful relationships with regulars and offer the flexibility that variety-minded diners desperately crave.

# Development process

Building the MVP for Maple was my first time using SwiftUI. As SwiftUI is still a relatively new language, a large part of the challenges came from implementing certain methods that were not supported. For example, when dragging the horizontal carousel view, the ability to have the current card in view slow down and "snap" into place, rather than whizzing past at the same speed as the other cards in the carousel:

Code snippet:

Design prototyping for Maple was done primarily in Adobe XD, as well as during the development process itself. The entirety of the profile screen was prototyped in SwiftUI without preliminary design prototyping, as was part of the Market View tab (first screen), as well as the point distribution popup in the Restaurant View.

# Supercharged 

<img src="supercharged screenshots/superchargedcover.png" width=1000><br>

Target Problem: Connecting with and meeting people for professional intentions of building out your network through 1:1 interactions is very time consuming in terms of figuring out who you want to connect to, before cold emailing or messaging them on LinkedIn, and then spending time on back and forth emails in order to schedule a coffee chat. And sometimes, after going through all that effort, the conversation doesn‚Äôt turn out to be that meaningful or helpful for you anyway. Additionally, with everything being virtual now, it‚Äôs difficult to have spontaneous interactions with acquaintances or with people who you usually run into often on campus but haven‚Äôt yet gotten a chance to know well. 

Within this larger problem, I focused on the problem of attending virtual events where a lot of the attendees are like-minded people and then never being able to really connect with them after the event is over. Usually in person, attendees would have the chance to meet each other at events, but that is not very possible with virtual speaker panel events, fireside chats, and webinars held over platforms like Zoom.

Supercharged seeks to provide event attendees with a chance to network after the conclusion of an event. Because it‚Äôs a wide pool of people, the platform will pair each person with another person for quick, speed rounds of 1:1 coffee chats. And after the initial networking sessions, there will also be other opportunities to network within the same group ‚Äì users can select time preferences and choose to opt in for a potential additional networking event, and if there are enough interested people, then the platform will organize another networking session. In this way, people can easily meet each other and will likely have some point of common interest, given that they attended an event together. There is no scheduling hassle and no back and forths ‚Äì the platform will do all the coordination for you.

### Brainstorming Process

<img src="supercharged screenshots/miroboard.png" width=650>

Supercharged actually started out as a personal CRM. Keeping track of my own professional network and growing relationships were pain points that I personally felt. However, after doing research on exisiting platforms (both ones that are currently active and ones that are inactive), I quickly realized that those personal CRM solutions were mainly centered around notifying the user to reach out to people, based on the user's settings of which people they wanted to prioritize in their network and when people's birthdays were. There was only so much that the platform could do -- while those personal CRM platforms had the functionality typical of a CRM in storing the previous history of contacts with a given person, most of the settings that affected how the user got prompted from the app to reach out were manually done. If only there were a personal CRM that scraped through the most recent LinkedIn / Twitter posts of a person in someone's network and somehow knew that the user themself would have something relevant to say based on the post and prompted them to reach out, with a recommendation of what to catch up on. The closest platform has been Monaru, which is more centered around recommending activities to do with personal relationships (in a more social, non-professional setting). 

The current version of Supercharged seeks to bring people together through the platform itself. This, of course, is much more dependent on the number of users who sign up for and are active on the platform, which is a weakness. However, Supercharged's vision is to bring people together post events past just swapping contact information. Supercharged brings people together both post events and through the platform's own networking sessions, matches people to network (both in group networking rounds and in independent 1:1's) based on interests and what people's needs actually are, incentivizes people to keep giving through networking conversations on the platform through giving them first pick of the draw for a future networking session, helps the user keep track of their growing network of people they met through events and through the platform, and much more.
